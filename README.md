# ML-Technique
All Programming implementation from Machine Learning Technique homework.
I try & implement the following machine learning algorithm:

* HW1
  * Hard-Margin Support Vector Machine (by cvxopt)
  * Soft-Margin Support Vector Machine (by sklearn)
* HW2
  * Adaboost + Decision Stump
  * Kernel Ridge Regession
* HW3
  * Decision Tree (CART)
  * Random Forest (CART)
* HW4
  * K-Means
  * K-Nearest Neighbor
  * Netural Network

All program is written by Python, parameters are fixed and you can just  command: `python {program name}.py`
